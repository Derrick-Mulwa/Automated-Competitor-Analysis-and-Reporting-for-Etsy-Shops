## Overview
This project centers on automating the generation of competitor analytics reports for Etsy shops, enabling efficient and timely insights that can enhance market strategy and profitability. By systematically analyzing posting behaviors and pricing strategies, the project leverages automated report generation to provide actionable intelligence, thereby fostering a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the project are as follows:

1. **Trend Analysis**: To investigate the frequency and timing of new item postings by competitors to identify emerging trends and consumer interests.
  
2. **Profit Projection**: To calculate future expected profits for specific products based on historical posting data, pricing strategies, and market demand.
  
3. **SEO Performance Assessment**: To analyze the SEO ranking of competitor listings to understand their visibility and effectiveness in attracting potential customers.
  
4. **Strategic Reporting**: To generate comprehensive reports that provide insights and recommendations for enhancing market positioning and sales strategies.

## Methodology
The project employs a structured approach to data analysis, utilizing a MySQL database to store relevant information gathered from various Etsy shops. Key components of the methodology include:

- **Data Acquisition and Storage**: 
  - **MySQL**: The data is organized in a structured database for efficient retrieval and manipulation.
  - **SQLAlchemy**: Utilized for seamless database interaction and management.

- **Data Processing and Analysis**: 
  - **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), allowing for efficient handling of large datasets.
  - **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical computations to derive statistical insights and perform calculations relevant to profit projections.

- **Automated Reporting**: 
  - **ReportLab**: This library enables the automatic generation of professional-grade PDF reports, encapsulating the analysis results in a visually appealing format. Each report includes key metrics, visualizations, and detailed explanations of findings.
  
- **Scheduled Automation**: 
  - **Windows Scheduler**: The report generation is automated and scheduled to run daily, ensuring that insights are consistently updated and readily available for decision-making.

## Results and Key Insights
The analysis yielded a wealth of insights regarding the competitor shops:

### Posting Behavior
- **Frequency of New Item Postings**: 
  The analysis revealed the average number of times items were posted as "New Item Posted" (NIP) by competitors, serving as a metric for assessing marketing effectiveness.

### Financial Projections
- **Expected Profit Calculations**: 
  By correlating the posting frequency with average sale prices, projections were made on potential earnings, enhancing strategic decision-making.

### SEO Analysis
- **SEO Ranking Insights**: 
  A detailed review of SEO ranking data highlighted opportunities for improvement in SEO strategies.
